## Dataset Description

The Zomato dataset provided valuable insights into customer preferences and restaurant operations, allowing us to identify opportunities for increasing profitability. By analyzing the data, we were able to identify the most popular cuisines, price ranges, and services offered by restaurants, as well as the countries with the highest willingness to spend on food. Using this information, we made recommendations to Zomato on how to tailor their promotions and advertisements to specific customer segments and expand into markets with high potential for profitability.

Additionally, we identified the importance of improving the customer experience, as seen in the positive relationship between restaurant ratings and their likelihood to offer table booking and online delivery services. Overall, these insights provided by the Zomato dataset helped in solving the profitability problem of Zomato, leading to increased market share and profits.

## Data Visualization and Insights

Data Visualization with monetary insights and reasons for their implementation

- The proportion of Restaurants with Table Booking and Online Delivery by Rating Text:

Zomato is facing the challenge of increasing customer retention and loyalty in the face of intense competition in the food delivery and restaurant industry. By analyzing the proportion of restaurants with table booking and online delivery options by rating text, Zomato can identify the preferences of its customers and tailor its offerings accordingly. 

For example, if a high proportion of customers in a particular rating category prefer restaurants with online delivery options, Zomato can focus on partnering with such restaurants to increase its offerings and attract more customers. Similarly, if customers in a certain rating category tend to prefer restaurants with table booking options, Zomato can encourage more restaurants to offer this service and highlight it on its platform.

- Aggregate rating vs. Votes:

Zomato is also facing the challenge of maintaining the quality of its restaurant listings and ratings. By analyzing the relationship between aggregate rating and votes, Zomato can identify potential cases of fake reviews or ratings manipulation. For example, if a restaurant has a high aggregate rating but a low number of votes, it may indicate that the restaurant has artificially inflated its rating. Conversely, if a restaurant has a low aggregate rating but a high number of votes, it may indicate that the restaurant is not receiving the attention it deserves and Zomato can take action to promote it better. By ensuring the accuracy and integrity of its ratings, Zomato can increase customer trust and loyalty, leading to increased profits.

And I propose the company, the can even turned into a new marketing strategy for Zomato. Idea here is: Zomato can play around these lines.

Advertising that is associated with human emotions and feelings has helped companies to connect with their audience on a deeper level and create a strong brand identity. This, in turn, creates positive associations with the brand and increases the likelihood that the consumer will remember the brand and be more likely to purchase from them in the future.

- Word cloud of cuisines in India, the US, and UAE where India has the biggest market:

Zomato is facing the challenge of catering to the diverse preferences of its customers across different geographies. By analyzing the word cloud of cuisines in India, the US, and UAE where India has the biggest market, Zomato can identify the most popular cuisines in each region and focus on promoting them. For example, if Indian cuisine is the most popular cuisine in the UAE, Zomato can work on partnering with more Indian restaurants in the region and promoting them more aggressively. Similarly, if Italian cuisine is popular in the US, Zomato can focus on improving its offerings in this category to attract more customers. By catering to the specific preferences of its customers, Zomato can increase customer retention and loyalty, leading to increased profits.

We also analyze the emerging cuisines trend, i.e., plant-based or Vegan options amongst customers & suggest relative ideas.

- Stacked bar chart of the Number of Restaurants by Price Range for the Top 10 Cities:

Zomato is facing the challenge of ensuring that its offerings are accessible and affordable to customers across different income levels. By analyzing the stacked bar chart of the number of restaurants by price range for the top 10 cities, Zomato can identify the price ranges that are most popular among its customers and tailor its offerings accordingly. 

For example, if the majority of customers in a particular city prefer restaurants in the mid-price range, Zomato can focus on partnering with such restaurants and promoting them more aggressively. Similarly, if customers in another city prefer restaurants in the high-price range, Zomato can work on expanding its offerings in this category to attract more customers. By catering to the specific price preferences of its customers, Zomato can increase customer retention and loyalty, leading to increased profits.

-  Map of Average Cost for Two by Country and Currency:
Zomato operates in multiple countries with varying currencies, and it is essential to understand the average cost for two people in each country to analyze the potential profit margins. The map visualization of Average Cost for Two by Country and Currency helps in identifying the average cost for two people in different countries where Zomato operates. The color gradient helps in identifying the countries where the cost for two people is high or low. This visualization can be beneficial in several ways to increase the profits of Zomato.

One of the problems that Zomato faces is the inconsistency of pricing across different countries. This visualization can help Zomato in setting the prices of the menu items across different countries more accurately. By analyzing the average cost for two in different countries, Zomato can make pricing decisions more precisely, which can lead to increased profits.

Another problem Zomato faces is maintaining consistent profit margins across different countries with varying currencies. By analyzing the average cost for two by currency, Zomato can understand the profit margins in different countries. This information can help Zomato in making informed decisions while expanding in new countries. They can use this information to select countries with higher profit margins, which can lead to increased profits in the long run.
